# Random Electric Circuits Simulation Using PSpice for Academic Purpose

This repository contains various electric circuit simulations performed using the PSpice simulation tool. These simulations were conducted for academic purposes to understand the behavior of different electrical circuits and their components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **PSpice**: Ensure you have PSpice installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Cadence website](https://www.cadence.com/content/cadence-www/global/en_US/home/tools/orcad-pspice-designer/pspice-technology.html).

### Running the Simulations

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jubayer98/Random-Electric-Circuits-Simulation-Using-PSpice-for-Academic-Purpose.git
   cd Random-Electric-Circuits-Simulation-Using-PSpice-for-Academic-Purpose
   ```

2. **Open PSpice:**
   - Launch the PSpice application on your computer.
   - Open the simulation files (`.sch` or `.cir`) included in the repository.

3. **Simulate:**
   - Run the simulations to analyze the circuits.
   - Observe and interpret the results, such as voltage, current, and other relevant parameters.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional circuits or improvements, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
